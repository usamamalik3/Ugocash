1. UGOCASH, LLC
This Privacy Policy includes important information about your personal data and we encourage you to read it carefully. Welcome We provide financial infrastructure for the internet. People use our services to enable their purchases and businesses of all sizes use our technology and services to accept payments, send payouts, and manage their businesses online. UgoCash wants to be clear about our use of the Personal Data that is entrusted to us. This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes the “Personal Data” that we collect about you, how we use it, how we share it, your rights and choices, and how you can contact us about our privacy practices. This Policy also outlines your data subject rights, including the right to object to some uses of your Personal Data by us. Please visit the UgoCash Privacy Center for more information about our privacy practices. “UgoCash”, “we”, “our” or “us” means the UgoCashentity responsible for the collection and use of Personal Data under this Privacy Policy. It differs depending on your jurisdiction. Learn More. “Personal Data” means any information that relates to an identified or identifiable individual, and can include information that you provide to us and that we collect about you, such as when you engage with our Services (e.g. device information, IP address). “Services” means the products and services that UgoCashindicates are covered by this Policy, which may include UgoCash-provided devices and apps. Our “Business Services” are Services provided by UgoCash to entities (“Business Users”) who directly and indirectly provide us with “End Customer” Personal Data in connection with those Business Users’ own business and activities. Our “End User Services” are those Services which UgoCashprovides directly to people (rather than entities) for their own use. “Sites” means Ugocash.net and the other websites, apps and online services that UgoCashindicates are covered by this Policy. Collectively, we refer to Sites, Business Services and End User Services as “Services”. Depending on the context, “you” means End Customer, End User, Representative or Visitor:

• When you directly use an End User Service for your personal use (such as when you sign up for Link, or make a payment to UgoCashClimate in your personal capacity), we refer to you as an “End User.”

• When you do business with, or otherwise transact with, a Business User (e.g. when you buy a pair of shoes from a merchant that uses UgoCashCheckout for payment processing) but are not directly doing business with UgoCash, we refer to you as an “End Customer.”

• When you are acting on behalf of an existing or potential Business User (e.g. you are a founder of a company, administer an account for a merchant who is a Business User, or receive an employee credit card from a Business User using UgoCashIssuing), we refer to you as a “Representative.”

• When you visit a Site without being logged into a UgoCashaccount or otherwise communicate with Ugocash, we refer to you as a “Visitor.” (e.g. you send UgoCash a message asking for more information because you are considering being a user of our products).

Depending on the activity, UgoCash acts as a “data controller” and/or “data processor (or service provider)” and for more information about this and on the UgoCashentity that is responsible under this Policy, see here.

1. Personal Data that we collect and how we use and share it Our collection and use of Personal Data changes depending on whether you are acting as End User, End Customer, Representative or Visitor and our different Services. For example, if you are the sole owner of a business (i.e., sole proprietorship), we may collect Personal Data to onboard your business, but you may also be an End Customer that purchased goods from another Business User that uses Ugocash’s Services for payment processing and you may also be an End User who uses Link to make those purchases. “Transaction Data” as used in this Privacy Policy includes Personal Data, and may include the following: your name, email address, billing address, shipping address, payment method information (such as credit or debit card number, bank account information or payment card image selected by you), merchant and location, purchase amount, date of purchase, and in some cases, some information about what you have purchased and your phone number and past purchases.

1.1 End Users We provide End User Services where we do not act as a service provider or processor to Businesses but instead provide the Services directly to you for your personal use (e.g. Link). We provide more information about our collection, use and sharing of Personal Data in our Privacy Center, including the legal bases which we rely on for using (processing) your Personal Data. a. Personal Data that we collect about End Users

• Using Link or Connecting your Bank Account. UgoCash offers you the opportunity to store your payment methods with UgoCash so that you can conveniently use it across merchants who are our Business Users (“Link” was formerly known as “Remember Me”). When you opt in to Link, you agree to let us store your Personal Data such as your payment method so that you can more readily make purchases through Link with Business Users of our payment processing Business Services (e.g. name, contact information, payment method details (e.g. card number, cvc, and expiration date)). When you choose to pay with Link, we will also collect Transaction Data related to your transactions. Learn More. o If you choose to share bank account information (including for use in Link) with us, UgoCash will periodically collect and process your account information (e.g. bank account owner information, account balances, account number and details, account transactions and, in some cases, credentials). With your separate permission, we will share this Personal Data with Business Users that you choose. You can ask us to stop collecting and sharing this information. Learn More. o With your separate permission, we will share contact information (e.g. shipping address, billing address and phone number) with Business Users that you do business with.

We use your Personal Data to provide the End User Service to you, including security, sanctions screening, delivery, support, personalization (e.g. language preferences and settings choices) and messages related to the End User Service (e.g. communicating Policy updates and information about our Services). For example, we will use Personal Data to assess whether your use of Link to make a payment with a merchant is authorized by you (and not a bad actor) and likely to be successfully authorized by the payment method you choose to use when you choose to make purchases with Link.
